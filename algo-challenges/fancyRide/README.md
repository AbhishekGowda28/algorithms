# Uber Ride

Being a new Uber user, you have â‚¹20 off your first ride. You want to make the most out of it and drive in the fanciest car you can afford, without spending any out-of-pocket money. There are 5 options, from the least to the most expensive: "UberX", "UberXL", "UberPlus", "UberBlack" and "UberSUV".

You know the length *l* of your ride in kilometers and how much one kilometer costs for each car. Find the best car you can afford.

**Example**

For *l* = 30 and fares = [0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1, 1.3], 

the output should be fancyRide(l, fares) = "UberXL".
