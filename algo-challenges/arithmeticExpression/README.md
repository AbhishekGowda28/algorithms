# arthimaticExpression 

Consider an arithmetic expression of the form A#B=C. Check whether it is possible to replace # with one of the four signs: +, -, * or / to obtain a correct expression.

**Example**
```
For A = 2, B = 3 and C = 5, we can replace # with a + to obtain 2 + 3 = 5, thus

arithmeticExpression(2, 3, 5) = true

```
