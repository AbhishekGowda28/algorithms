# Flatten Array

Flatten a nested array. You must account for varying levels of nesting.

This problem can also be solved using Array Method [Array.flat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/flat).

**Example**
- flattenArray([[["a"]], [["b"]]]) should return ["a", "b"]
- flattenArray([1, [2], [3, [[4]]]]) should return [1, 2, 3, 4]
