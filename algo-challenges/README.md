# arrayChange

You are given an array of integers. On each move you are allowed to increase exactly one of its element by one. 
Find the minimal number of moves required to obtain a strictly increasing sequence from the input.

**Example**
```
For inputArray = [1, 1, 1], the output should be
arrayChange(inputArray) = 3.
```

# arrayConversion

Given an array of 2*k integers (for some integer k), perform the following operation untill the array contains only one element: 
 - On the 1st, 3rd, 5th etc iterations replace each pair of consecutive elements with their sum.
 - On the 2nd, 4th, 6th etc iterations replace each pair of consecutive elements with their procudct. 
 
 After the alogrithm has finished, there will be a single element left in the array. Return that element

 **Example**
```
 For inputArray = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8], the output should be arrayConversion(inputArray) = 186;

 1st iteration -> [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] => [3,7,11,15]
 2nd iteration -> [3,7,11,15] => [21,165]
 3rd iteration -> [21,165] => 186
```

# arrayMaxConsecutiveSum

Given array of integers, find the maximal possible sum of some of its k consecutive elements.

**Example**
```
For inputArray = [2, 3, 5, 1, 6] and k = 2, the output should be arrayMaxConsecutiveSum(inputArray, k) = 8.

All possible sums of 2 consecutive elements are:
2 + 3 = 5;
3 + 5 = 8;
5 + 1 = 6;
1 + 6 = 7.
Thus, the answer is 8.
```

# boxBlur

Last night you had to study, but decided to party instead. Now there is a black and white photo of you that is about to go viral. You cannot let this ruin your reputation, so you want to apply box blur algorithm to the photo to hide its content.
The algorithm works as follows: each pixel x in the resulting image has a value equal to the average value of the input image pixels' values from the 3 Ã— 3 square with the center at x. All pixels at the edges are cropped.
As pixel's value is an integer, all fractions should be rounded down.

**Example**
```
For image = [[1, 1, 1], 
            [1, 7, 1], 
            [1, 1, 1]]
the output should be boxBlur(image) = [[1]].
In the given example all boundary pixels were cropped, and the value of the pixel in the middle was obtained as 
(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 7 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) / 9 = 15 / 9 = rounded down = 1.
```
---
# buildPalindrome

Given a string, find the shortest possible string which can be achieved by adding characters to the end of initial string to make it a palindrome.

```
---
# candies

n children have got m pieces of candy. They want to eat as much candy as they can, but each child must eat exactly the same amount of candy as any other child. Determine how many pieces of candy will be eaten by all the children together. Individual pieces of candy cannot be split.

**Example**
```
-   For n = 3 and m = 10, the output should be candies(n, m) = 9.

    Each child will eat 3 pieces. So the answer is 9.
 
    The total number of pieces of candy the children will eat provided they eat as much as they can and all 
    children eat the same amount.

# domainType

A domain registrar makes a lot of different top-level domains available to its customers. A top-level domain is one that goes directly after the last dot ('.') in the domain name, for example .com in example.com. To help the users choose from available domains, domain registrar is introducing a new feature that shows the type of the chosen top-level domain. You have to implement this feature.
To begin with, you want to write a function that labels the domains as "commercial", "organization", "network" or "information" for .com, .org, .net or .info respectively.
For the given list of domains return the list of their labels.

**Example**
```
- For domains = ["example.org", "example.com", "example.net", "example.info", "example.gov"], 
domainType(domains) = ["organization", "commercial", "network", "information", "government"].
```
---
# depositeProfit

You have deposited a specific amount into your bank account. Each year your balance increases at the same growth rate. Find out how long it would take for your balance to pass a specific threshold with the assumption that you don't make any additional deposits.

**Example**

For deposit = 100, rate = 20 and threshold = 170, the output should be
depositProfit(deposit, rate, threshold) = 3.

Each year the amount of money on your account increases by 20%. It means that throughout the years your balance would be:

- **year 0: 100;**
- **year 1: 120;**
- **year 2: 144;**
- **year 3: 172,8.**

Thus, it will take 3 years for your balance to pass the threshold, which is the answer.

# Uber Ride

Being a new Uber user, you have â‚¹20 off your first ride. You want to make the most out of it and drive in the fanciest car you can afford, without spending any out-of-pocket money. There are 5 options, from the least to the most expensive: "UberX", "UberXL", "UberPlus", "UberBlack" and "UberSUV".

You know the length *l* of your ride in kilometers and how much one kilometer costs for each car. Find the best car you can afford.

**Example**

For *l* = 30 and fares = [0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1, 1.3], 

the output should be fancyRide(l, fares) = "UberXL".

---
# Uber Fair Estimation

Uber is building a Fare Estimator that can tell you how much your ride will cost before you request it. It works by passing approximated ride distance and ride time through this formula:

(Cost per minute) * (ride time) + (Cost per kilo meters) * (ride distance)

where Cost per minute and Cost per kilo meters depend on the car type.

You are one of the engineers building the Fare Estimator, so knowing cost per minute and cost per kilo meters for each car type, as well as ride distance and ride time, return the fare estimates for all car types. 

**Example**

For ride_time = 30, ride_distance = 7, cost_per_minute = [0.2, 0.35, 0.4, 0.45] and cost_per_km = [1.1, 1.8, 2.3, 3.5], 

the output should be fareEstimator(ride_time, ride_distance, cost_per_minute, cost_per_km) = [13.7, 23.1, 28.1, 38].

---
# Sum of Houses

A boy is walking a long way from school to his home. To make the walk more fun he decides to add up all the numbers of the houses that he passes by during his walk. Unfortunately, not all of the houses have numbers written on them, and on top of that the boy is regularly taking turns to change streets, so the numbers don't appear to him in any particular order.

At some point during the walk the boy encounters a house with number 0 written on it, which surprises him so much that he stops adding numbers to his total right after seeing that house.

For the given sequence of houses determine the sum that the boy will get. It is guaranteed that there will always be at least one 0 house on the path.

**Example**

For inputArray = [5, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 5, 0, 2], the output should be houseNumbersSum(inputArray) = 11.

---
# isIPv4Address

An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device (e.g., computer, printer) participating in a computer network  that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. 
There are two versions of the Internet protocol, and thus two versions of addresses. 
One of them is the IPv4 address.

---
# isMAC48Address

A media access control address (MAC address) is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communications on the physical network segment.

The standard (IEEE 802) format for printing MAC-48 addresses in human-friendly form is six groups of two hexadecimal digits (0 to 9 or A to F), 
separated by hyphens (e.g. 01-23-45-67-89-AB).

Your task is to check by given string inputString whether it corresponds to MAC-48 address or not.

# knapsackWeight

You found two items in a treasure chest! The first item weighs weight1 and is worth value1,  and the second item weighs weight2 and is worth value2. 
What is the total maximum value of the items you can take with you, assuming that your max weight capacity is maxW and you can't come back for the items later?

**Example**

- For value1 = 10, weight1 = 5, value2 = 6, weight2 = 4 and maxW = 8, the output should be knapsackWeight(value1, weight1, value2, weight2, maxW) = 10.

You can only carry the first item.

- For value1 = 10, weight1 = 5, value2 = 6, weight2 = 4 and maxW = 9, the output should be knapsackWeight(value1, weight1, value2, weight2, maxW) = 16.

You're strong enough to take both of the items with you.

---
# Line Encoding

Given a string, return its encoding defined as follows:

First, the string is divided into the least possible number of disjoint substrings consisting of identical characters for example, "aabbbc" is divided into ["aa", "bbb", "c"]
Next, each substring with length greater than one is replaced with a concatenation of its length and the repeating character for example, substring "bbb" is replaced by "3b"
Finally, all the new strings are concatenated together in the same order and a new string is returned.

**Example**

For line = "aabbbc", the output should be lineEncoding(line) = "2a3bc".

---
# Increment Backups

One of the easiest ways to back up files is with an incremental backup. This method only backs up files that have changed since the last backup.

You are given a list of changes that were made to the files in your database, where for each valid i, fileChanges[i][0] is the timestamp of the time the change was made, and fileChanges[i][1] is the file id.

Knowing the timestamp of the last backup lastBackupTime, your task is to find the files which should be included in the next backup. Return the ids of the files that should be backed up as an array sorted in ascending order.

**Example**

For lastBackupTime = 461620205 and fileChanges = [[461620203, 1], [461620204, 2], [461620205, 6], [461620206, 5], [461620207, 3], [461620207, 5], [461620208, 1]] the output should be incrementalBackups(lastBackupTime, fileChanges) = [1, 3, 5].

---
# Late Ride

One night you go for a ride on your motorcycle. At 00:00 you start your engine, and the built-in timer automatically begins counting the length of your ride, in minutes. Off you go to explore the neighborhood.

When you finally decide to head back, you realize there's a chance the bridges on your route home are up, leaving you stranded! Unfortunately, you don't have your watch on you and don't know what time it is. All you know thanks to the bike's timer is that n minutes have passed since 00:00.

Using the bike's timer, calculate the current time. Return an answer as the sum of digits that the digital timer in the format hh:mm would show.

**Example**

- For n = 240, the output should be lateRide(n) = 4.

Since 240 minutes have passed, the current time is 04:00. The digits sum up to 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 = 4, which is the answer.

- For n = 808, the output should be lateRide(n) = 14.

808 minutes mean that it's 13:28 now, so the answer should be 1 + 3 + 2 + 8 = 14.

---
# Longest Digit Prefix

Given a string, output its longest prefix which contains only digits.

**Example**

- For inputString="123aa1", the output should be longestDigitsPrefix(inputString) = "123".

---
# Maximum Multiple

Given a divisor and a bound, find the largest integer N such that:

- N is divisible by divisor.
- N is less than or equal to bound.
- N is greater than 0.

It is guaranteed that such a number exists.

**Example**

For divisor = 3 and bound = 10, the output should be maxMultiple(divisor, bound) = 9.
The largest integer divisible by 3 and not larger than 10 is 9.

---
# messageFromBinaryCode

You are taking part in an Escape Room challenge designed specifically for programmers. 
In your efforts to find a clue, you've found a binary code written on the wall behind a vase, and realized that it must be an encrypted message. 
After some thought, your first guess is that each consecutive 8 bits of the code stand for the character with the corresponding extended ASCII code.

Assuming that your hunch is correct, decode the message.

**Example**

#For code = "010010000110010101101100011011000110111100100001", the output should be messageFromBinaryCode(code) = "Hello!".

The first 8 characters of the code are 01001000, which is 72 in the binary numeral system. 
72 stands for H in the ASCII-table, so the first letter is H.
Other letters can be obtained in the same manner.

# minimalNumberOfCoins

You find yourself in Bananaland trying to buy a banana. You are super rich so you have an unlimited supply of banana-coins, but you are trying to use as few coins as possible.

The coin values available in Bananaland are stored in a sorted array coins. coins[0] = 1, and for each i (0 < i < coins.length) coins[i] is divisible by coins[i - 1]. Find the minimal number of banana-coins you'll have to spend to buy a banana given the banana's price.

**Example**

For coins = [1, 2, 10] and price = 28, the output should be minimalNumberOfCoins(coins, price) = 6.
You have to use 10 twice, and 2 four times.

# mostFrequentDigitSum

A step(x) operation works like this: it changes a number x into x - s(x), where s(x) is the sum of x's digits. You like applying functions to numbers, so given the number n, you decide to build a decreasing sequence of numbers: n, step(n), step(step(n)), etc., with 0 as the last element.

Building a single sequence isn't enough for you, so you replace all elements of the sequence with the sums of their digits (s(x)). Now you're curious as to which number appears in the new sequence most often. If there are several answers, return the maximal one.

**Example**

- For n = 88, the output should be mostFrequentDigitSum(n) = 9. Here is the first sequence you built: 88, 72, 63, 54, 45, 36, 27, 18, 9, 0. And here is s(x) for each of its elements: 16, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0.  As you can see, the most frequent number in the second sequence is 9.

- For n = 8, the output should be mostFrequentDigitSum(n) = 8. At first you built the following sequence: 8, 0. s(x) for each of its elements is: 8, 0. As you can see, the answer is 8 (it appears as often as 0, but is greater than it).

# Pig Latin

Translate the provided string to pig latin.

Pig Latin takes the first consonant (or consonant cluster) of an English word, moves it to the end of the word and suffixes an "ay".

If a word begins with a vowel you just add "way" to the end.

**Example**

- pigLatin("glove") should return "oveglay".
- pigLatin("eight") should return "eightway".

# proCategorization

Thumbtack helps Professionals (Pros) grow their business by identifying new customers. Upon registering on Thumbtack, a Pro specifies which categories of services they provide. To help match customer requests with qualified Pros, Thumbtack maintains a list of Pros grouped by service categories.

Given a list of pros and their category preferences, return the list of Pros for each category.

**Example**

For pros = ["Jack", "Leon", "Maria"] and

preferences = [["Computer repair", "Handyman", "House cleaning"], ["Computer lessons", "Computer repair", "Data recovery service"], ["Computer lessons", "House cleaning"]]

Output -> proCategorization(pros, preferences) = 
[
    [
        ["Computer lessons"], ["Leon", "Maria"]
    ], 
    [
        ["Computer repair"], ["Jack", "Leon"]
    ], 
    [
        ["Data recovery service"], ["Leon"]
    ], 
    [
        ["Handyman"], ["Jack"]
    ], 
    [
        ["House cleaning"], ["Jack", "Maria"]
    ]

# Capatilize word

Proper nouns always begin with a capital letter, followed by small letters.

Correct a given proper noun so that it fits this statement.

**Example**

- For noun = "John", the output should be capatilize(noun) = "John".

---
# ratingThreshold

In Thumbtack, users are able to rate Pros based on their experience working with them. Each rating is an integer ranging from 1 to 5, and all ratings are averaged to produce a single number rating for any given Pro. Those Pros who have a rating lower than a specified threshold are manually reviewed by Thumbtack staff to ensure high quality of service.

You're given a list of ratings for some Pros. Find out which Pros should be manually reviewed.

**Example**

- For threshold = 3.5 and ratings = [[3, 4], [3, 3, 3, 4], [4]] the output should be ratingThreshold(threshold, ratings) = [1].

`Assume that we have 3 Pros that have received the following ratings: [3, 4], [3, 3, 3, 4] and [4]. Then And if threshold = 3.5 the answer is ratingThreshold(threshold, ratings) = [1]. The first Pro's rating is 3.5, the second one's is 3.25, and the last one's is 4, so only the second Pro should be reviewed manually (the output is their 0-based index).`

# Stolen Lunch

When you recently visited your little nephew, he told you a sad story: there's a bully at school who steals his lunch every day, and locks it away in his locker. He also leaves a note with a strange, coded message. Your nephew gave you one of the notes in hope that you can decipher it for him. And you did: it looks like all the digits in it are replaced with letters and vice versa. Digit 0 is replaced with 'a', 1 is replaced with 'b' and so on, with digit 9 replaced by 'j'.

The note is different every day, so you decide to write a function that will decipher it for your nephew on an ongoing basis.

**Example**

For note = "you'll n4v4r 6u4ss 8t: cdja", the output should be stolenLunch(note) = "you'll never guess it: 2390".

---
# Sum of all Primes

Sum all the prime numbers up to and including the provided number.

A prime number is defined as a number greater than one and having only two divisors, one and itself. For example, 2 is a prime number because it's only divisible by one and two.

The provided number may not be a prime.

**Example**

- sumAllPrimes(10) should return 17

- sumAllPrimes(977) should return 73156

---
# Sum of odd Fibonacci numbers

Given a positive integer num, return the sum of all odd Fibonacci numbers that are less than or equal to num.

The first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 1 and 1. Every additional number in the sequence is the sum of the two previous numbers. The first six numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8.

**Example**

- sumOddFibonacciNums(10) should return 10

For example, sumFibs(10) should return 10 because all odd Fibonacci numbers less than or equal to 10 are 1, 1, 3, and 5.

---
# Sort array elements based on the provided feild.

An array of object is provided. Sort the given array in ascending order, based on the provided field.

# Tasks Type

You have some tasks in your Asana account. For each ith of them you know its deadlinesi, which is the last day by which it should be completed. As you can see in your calendar, today's date is day. Asana labels each task in accordance with its due date:

- If the task is due today or it's already overdue, it is labeled as Today;
- If the task is due within a week but not today - that is, its deadline is somewhere between day + 1 and day + 7 both inclusive - it is labeled as Upcoming;
- All other tasks are labeled as Later;

Given an array of deadlines and today's date day, your goal is to find the number of tasks with each label type and return it as an array with the format [Today, Upcoming, Later], where Today, Upcoming and Later are the number of tasks that correspond to that label.

**Example**

- For deadlines = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and day = 2, the output should be tasksTypes(deadlines, day) = [2, 3, 0].

![Image](https://codefightsuserpics.s3.amazonaws.com/tasks/tasksTypes/img/example2.png?_tm=1491409778572)

- For deadlines = [1, 2, 4, 2, 10, 3, 1, 4, 5, 4, 9, 8] and day = 1, the output should be tasksTypes(deadlines, day) = [2, 8, 2].

# shapeArea

Below we will define an n-interesting polygon. Your task is to find the area of a polygon for a given n.

A 1-interesting polygon is just a square with a side of length 1. An n-interesting polygon is obtained by taking the n - 1-interesting polygon and appending 1-interesting polygons to its rim, side by side. You can see the 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-interesting polygons in the picture below.

![Image](https://codefightsuserpics.s3.amazonaws.com/tasks/shapeArea/img/area.png?_tm=1491302317375)

**Example**

- For n = 2, the output should be shapeArea(n) = 5;

- For n = 3, the output should be shapeArea(n) = 13.

# CheckBook Balance

You are given a small checkbook to balance that is given to you as a string. Sometimes, this checkbook will be cluttered by non-alphanumeric characters.

The first line shows the original balance. Each other (not blank) line gives information: check number, category, and check amount.

You need to clean the lines first, keeping only letters, digits, dots, and spaces. Next, return the report as a string. On each line of the report, you have to add the new balance. In the last two lines, return the total expenses and average expense. Round your results to two decimal places. 

**Example**

1000.00
125 Market 125.45
126 Hardware 34.95
127 Video 7.45
