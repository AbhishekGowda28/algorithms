# applesDistribution

There are some apples. You are going to distribute them into gift boxes in such a way that boxes will contain equal number of apples. It's possible that some of the apples won't be used but there is a max limit on the number of apples that can be left out.

Assume that you have an infinite amount of gift boxes and that all the boxes have equal capacity.

Find the number of different apple distributions satisfying all of the above conditions.

**Example**
```
for apples = 7, boxCapacity = 4, maxResidue = 1 output should be 3
```
