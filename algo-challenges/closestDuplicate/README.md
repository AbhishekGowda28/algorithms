# Closest Duplicate

Given an array that contains, find the closest duplicate for which the second occurrence has the minimal index. In other words, if there are more than 1 duplicate, return for which the second occurrence has a smaller index than the second occurrence. If there are no such elements, return `undefined`.

**Example**


- For inputArray = [2, 1, 3, 5, 3, 2], the output should be closestDuplicate(inputArray) = 3.

- For inputArray = [2, 4, 3, 5, 1], the output should be closestDuplicate(inputArray) = undefined.
